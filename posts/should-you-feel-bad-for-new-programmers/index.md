These are my thoughts on whether [ThePrimeagen should feel bad for new programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkuqEWxWI-M&t=240s), as I'm a new programmer myself (compared to him). It is also a reflection on my [previous post](./how-i-learned-programming) on how I learn't programming myself after almost 2 years. The idea of commenting on how I should have learned versus how I have learned is somewhat paradoxical but I will try to do as much justice I can. The key takeaway is that it all boils down to one thing: motivation.

The most significant problem of this discussion is the seperation between what's more difficult, and what's more effective in learning programming. I will not use them interchangeably, as you will see later, some difficult things can actually make learning more effective.

## My Programming Expedition

My programming journey was never a "journey". It was an expedition. The only analogy I can give to my journey is of an 18th century cartographer who has a goal but doesn't know where he is going. People call it a journey when they know 
- where they are going and 
- how they are going. 

I knew none of these. I only knew "why" I was going. In my initial days, most of my talk with myself looked like the following:

Exhibit A:

> How do I make a website! I can save a text file as HTML and it shows up in the browser? WOW! Hmm why can't I open this URL in my mobile. Oh so you need to server which serves this file? Why does this stupid IIS not work properly. Wait. This still doesn't open on other devices. What's a localhost lol. Dang it. \*googles online HTML hosting solutions\*. \*googles online static site hosting solutions\*. \*creates a github account\*. \*can't understand shit so closes and goes to sleep\*.

Exhibit B:

> \*watches networkchuck hosting pi-hole on his server and blocking all ads on his router\*. Damn I need a VPS. \*spends the next month trying to find out the free VPS providers\*. Dad I want an oracle cloud account. Please. Why can't I SSH into this :sob:. Where's my private key. Wait so what's the other one for. \*Finally manages to login and runs sudo apt update after a week of struggle\*. Haha look at me I'm a hacker. Right so I pasted all the commands correctly and changed by DNS server on the router. \*all websites stop working and there is panic in my home\*. Turns out the DNS server doesn't accept connections on port 53. How do I change firewall rules. Ok so I need to run sudo vim /etc/iptables/rules.v4. Why can't I quit this stupid vim thing :sob:. \*manually shuts down the entire VM from oracle cloud and calls it a day\*.

Exhibit C:

> Hey, you have a discord bot? You run it on your laptop lmao. I can host it for you. I've got a free server. Please give me the code please. Right, so what have we got here. What's a javascript again? Oh so it's not Java. Got it. How to run a .js file. No wait, how to "execute" a .js file. So I need to install node. \*runs node index.js and gets a bunch of module not found errors.\* Ok so npm install. Wow the bot is online. \*bot is offline as soon as I close the terminal\*. How do I make it run even after the terminal is closed? Wait so I need docker? Hmm a dockerfile. \*writes some shitty dockerfile that barely works\*. \*troubleshoots errors in javascript code after each new feature added by the friend for the next year\*. \*gets dozens of eureka moments along the way\*. \*Eventually lands at fireship\*.

My journey was so painful I feel tired even thinking about those days. I had no clue what to do. I was like Pi from _Life of Pi_ and my boat was google search. Everything was soooo damn hard. Nobody I knew was into coding. I was barely in high school. No teachers, no courses, no guidance. Just google and stackoverflow. For 2 whole years. I did absolutely random unrelated stuff. Started a blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, hosted open source random stuff on my VPS, wrote a shitty javascript discord bot, made a pure React website for calculating basic math stuff called [Studious Guide](https://math.kush.in/). I was so bad at these things. When I look at the code I wrote I cannot help but laugh how stupid it was. Yet, even after so many miserable failures I never lost the "why" of learning what I was learning.

I didn't set out to specifically learn programming or CS. I had tried that earlier in middle school by taking a C++ course. The only thing I learned is basic loops and clicking on the run button before quitting the course entirely. I just started the course because someone told me it is good to learn coding. There was no reason for me to continue as I found it boring.

The second time that I started out I had a goal. I need to fix the errors in the bot and impress my friends. I need to do all this cool stuff people are doing on their servers. I want my own public website. I want everything to run properly even when I'm asleep. I want to look like a hacker. These were my objectives. My objectives were not to learn basic C++ and write a for loop. My objective was to "get stuff done". And the only way I could get it done was by learning a few things here and there.

All this time I ran out of energy multiple times. I made thousands of mistakes. But I never lost my objective. Even though things were so difficult, after months of struggle I always got an end product that was so impressive (as per my standards). And without even realizing I had learned so many things that otherwise would have taken me years of college lessons and job experience to learn.

This was all about my expedition. Now let's talk about how I "would" have learned given that I knew what's coming ahead.
