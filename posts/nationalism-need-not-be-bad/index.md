This is my second political post after my previous post on [morality](./does-it-need-to-be-immoral-to-cause-harm). I am planning to do a series on defending some of the conservative ideas in a more rational way contrary to what most conservatives do. I am always intrigued by the fact that all liberal ideas _sound_ so _good_. It feels like liberalism and socialism has a moral high ground when it comes to ideals. If implemented, the left liberal dream sounds like utopia, and the only way in which conservatives counter the arguments is by using realism. Because there simply seems to be no way to put conservative ideas in a more "good" sounding way. Let me provide a few examples. 

- We must provide refuge to all those who seek. Every human deserves to have food and shelter. 
- We must believe that we are part of one giant community of human beings and not be divided by land borders.
- Billionaires shouldn't exist and people must donate all of their excess wealth for the poor. Everybody must have equal financial status and no one should be left out.
- People can choose whatever they want to do in life. The government should never intervene in personal choices.
- Everybody must have the right to choose their leaders.

You must notice how they all sound so virtuous. The term they use nowadays is "political correctness" to describe all these virtuous sounding statements that are impractical in real life. Now, obviously people have various arguments against these ideas. However, sit back for a moment and recall when was the last time you heard a conservative trying to defend his stance by actually pointing out that his argument is also just as virtuous? Most of the time these arguments are retaliated by the help of realism. 

> Well there isn't enough resources in our country to allow mass immigration. What if some of the immigrants are here to execute their radical ideas in our civilized society?

> It is not possible for all cultures to stay in harmony, because we have fundamentally different values than other nations, which is why we must preserve our nation from other cultures.

> The rich are the people who create immense opportunity for employment. Financial inequality is natural and inevitable. We have already seen how communism failed in the Soviet Union.

> Yeah if everybody can do whatever they want then everybody will become a drug addict and our nation will decline. We must place checks against several things to ensure security for the people.

You might have heard these arguments. There is an endless reservoir of short form content trying to "debunk" delusional "woke idiots" by hitting them with "reality".

However, I am personally not satisfied. Most of the arguments lack virtue and just sound selfish and cynical. I think I have better defenses for some of the conservative ideas that can be just as virtuous and practical. And in these posts I would like to discuss some of them.

## Current View of Nationalism

Here's how a quick google search defines it:

> identification with one's own nation and support for its interests, especially to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations.

This not what I mean by nationalism and I will come back later on this, but this definition is the reason one of my friends says he is not "nationalist" and just patriotic. Patriotic is 

> the quality of being patriotic; devotion to and vigorous support for one's country.

However, I want to find a middle ground among these two terms. 

Today nationalism is not considered virtuous by the left. And historically, nationalism has caused several wars to serve as testimony for being evil. I was surprised when I learned how unpopular nationalism is in the West. Being an Indian, patriotism and nationalism are things taught to us since childhood. Eastern countries like India are infamous for their nationalist population, and people are often mocked on social media for always trying to defend their country. This was bit of a shock for me because I never thought of love for my country as something to be ashamed of, but soon enough I realised why I was not wrong. The perspective I am about to provide here is highly "Indian" in values and will defer significantly from what the West calls nationalism.

## Enter Western Nationalism

Having been taught a lot of conservative values in an Indian family, I was always biased towards conservative speakers in the West. They seemed so logical when trying to "debunk" _woke idiots_. Nothing in the world made more sense. Obviously, progressives are like a cancer in the society spreading delusional ideas. Soon enough I was about to get a setback. I heard about [Tucker Carlson's take on British imperialism](https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1568034996622970880).

In fact, I saw an attack after attack on Indians. Orthodox Christians called us uncivilized filthy people who followed a satanic religion. Chinese social media thinks we're dirty brown idiots. Radical islamists call us _kaafir_ and sinners for worshipping idols. Tucker Carlson thinks british civilized us. It is not that some blind racist bigots insulting us, but really intellectual influencers and politicians share the same opinion. But this is not exclusively towards Indians. Nationalism everywhere around the world is established only by showing everyone else inferior and despicable to highlight the superiority of their nation. And do you know the weirdest thing that comes after these insults? Obviously our nationalist counter these, but from the West the ONLY people who support and empathize with us are the same people whom they call "woke" idiots. So people of opposite ideology are coming to support us and the people who made the most sense are busy brutally attacking our history as if we must be ashamed for not being American or British. So that was my moment of realisation that the people who I saw on social media were no friends of mine.

That convinced me how Western nationalism is evil. Why be exclusive to the West, even Chinese nationalism is no different. But when I introspected, I thought to myself, I am a nationalist. I think India is great and my ancestors have given us a great culture. Despite, knowing this, I still had a fascination for the wonderful things that the West has. I have immense respect for Western intellectuals, inventors, scientists. I grew up learning about Socrates and Plato, learning Newtonian physics. I loved the tales of Jesus and how he forgave people for their sins. My head bows to the man who has the courage to say "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" when being nailed on a wooden cross. I learned about Joan of Arc and appreciated her french nationalism. I have always loved the wonderful things other cultures and nations have taught us. Yet all my love for the West was only one sided. This felt like a betrayal. I love Jesus but his followers hate me for being a Hindu. Why do they insist on me changing my religion and accepting that Jesus is the ONLY way to heaven? Isn't Jesus the same as Ram? Well, my culture told me all avatars (incarnations) of God have done wonderful things on earth, and I will be glad to consider Jesus an avatar, if only his followers allow me to.

This made me realise the fundamental difference between what I call nationalism and what the rest of the world calls nationalism. I would like to describe this difference by giving an example of two sanskrit words. अहंकार and अस्मिता. Sadly I cannot find the exact English words which convey the precise meanings. In fact google just translates them both into "ego". But in reality the difference is quite significant. अस्मिता is when you think you are great, you have self-respect and pride for yourself and the things you represent, like family and culture or community. अहंकार is also when you think you are great. Unlike अस्मिता however, अहंकार is when you think YOU are great, and everybody else is inferior. This is why अहंकार is considered to be evil, while अस्मिता is a virtue.
