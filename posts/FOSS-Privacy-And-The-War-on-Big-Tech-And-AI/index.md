## Big Tech is Not Always Evil

So how many times have you just wandered out thinking that all oil corporations are evil and you need to make your gas station? Oh, and just the gas station won't help since you also decide to create your refinery and purchase an oil well. You see, when we say we want an internet free of big tech, we make similar claims. There is no way we can make everything free of cost for everyone. It violates the fabric of the economy.

### Big Tech is Just a Business

We must understand this. Most people agree communist ideas didn't work. Not an expert here, but there is quite a lot of similarity between people saying we should get rid of big tech and the communists. Just like we can't get rid of oil companies and build everything free of cost, we can't throw away software companies like Google as well.
